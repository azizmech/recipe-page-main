- Using custom design for coloring list bullets :

<ul class="ingredients__list">
  <li class="ingredients__item">...</li>
</ul>
```

```css
.preparation__item::before {
  content: "â€¢";
  font-size: 1.5rem;
  color: var(--color-dark-raspberry);
  display: inline-block;
  ...;
}
```

- Using marker element for coloring the ordered list:

```html
<ol instruction__list>
  <li class="instruction__item">...</li>
</ol>
```

```css
.instruction__item::marker {
  color: var(--color-nutmeg);
  font-weight: 700;
}
```
